- **Maximum Drawdown**: <8%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: >1.8  
- **Win Rate**: 55-65%
- **Capital Utilization**: 45-50% average (never >50%)

### Core Value Proposition
A conservative yet sophisticated trading system that uses only 50% of available capital to trade the top 10-15 highest-probability opportunities from the Nifty universe, employing institutional-grade risk management and execution algorithms.

## 🎯 Product Overview

- **Deployable Capital**: Maximum 50% of total capital
- **Cash Reserve**: Minimum 50% always maintained
- **Emergency Buffer**: Additional 10% reserve for opportunities

**Position Sizing Parameters**:
- **Maximum Position Size**: 8% of deployable capital per stock
- **Minimum Position Size**: 3% of deployable capital per stock

2. **Conviction Adjustment**: Multiply by conviction score (0.5-1.0)
3. **Volatility Adjustment**: Divide by ATR-based multiplier
4. **Correlation Adjustment**: Reduce for correlated positions
5. **Limit Application**: Apply min/max position constraints
6. **Sector Check**: Validate sector concentration limits

**Volatility Multipliers**:
- Low volatility (ATR < 2%): 1.0x (no adjustment)
- Medium volatility (ATR 2-4%): 1.3x (reduce position)
- High volatility (ATR > 4%): 1.7x (significantly reduce)

### 3. Risk Management Framework
